# FastAPI Service

Use this skill to keep API and service code aligned with this repo's Python/FastAPI conventions instead of generic internet defaults.

## Project Fit

- Runtime: Python 3.12.
- Web framework: FastAPI.
- Validation and response models: Pydantic v2-style models.
- Dependency management: FastAPI `Depends` for request/route concerns; `svcs` registries and registrars for application/infrastructure dependencies.
- Persistence: Piccolo/PostgreSQL and async database boundaries where applicable.
- Logging/observability: structured logging, request context, middleware, and telemetry hooks.

## FastAPI Boundaries

- Keep HTTP concerns in `llm_agent/llm_agent/api/http/`: route definitions, DTOs, mappers, middleware, status codes, and request context extraction.
- Prefer declarative route definitions with explicit `response_model`, summaries, and useful response metadata for public endpoints.
- Use Pydantic models for input/output validation. Do not pass raw dictionaries across boundaries when a typed model, dataclass, or domain object would clarify intent.
- Use `HTTPException` for expected HTTP-facing failures. Translate domain exceptions at the route boundary.
- Keep route handlers thin: validate/extract request data, call a service, map the result to a DTO.
- Prefer `lifespan` and the existing `svcs.fastapi.lifespan` pattern for startup/shutdown work. Do not add new `@app.on_event` handlers.

## Python Style

- Use `def` for pure synchronous functions and `async def` for I/O-bound operations.
- Type all public function signatures, service methods, route dependencies, DTO mappers, and test helpers.
- Prefer module-level named routers, dependencies, mappers, and utility functions.
- Prefer small, composable functions over duplicated branches.
- Use descriptive snake_case names, especially boolean names with `is_`, `has_`, `can_`, or `should_`.
- Prefer object-in/object-out APIs for complex calls: accept a typed request/config object and return a typed result object.
- Write Python docstrings as a single summary sentence, a blank line, then concise detail only when needed. Use simple reStructuredText fields (`:param name:`, `:return:`, `:raises Error:`) for non-obvious parameter, return, and error semantics; avoid docstrings that only repeat the signature.
- Avoid forcing a functional rewrite where existing classes intentionally model service boundaries, registrars, or lifecycle-owned dependencies.

## Error Handling

- Put guard clauses and edge-case handling near the top of functions.
- Avoid deeply nested `if`/`else` blocks when early returns or exception translation make control flow clearer.
- Use domain-specific exceptions for business failures and translate them once at the API boundary.
- Log unexpected failures with useful context, but do not log raw tokens, secrets, or sensitive request bodies.
- Keep client-facing error messages stable and useful without leaking internals.

## Async And Performance

- Do not perform blocking I/O in request handlers or async service methods.
- Use async database and external API calls.
- Avoid unbounded fan-out, unbounded background tasks, or fire-and-forget work without lifecycle ownership.
- For large or frequently accessed responses, consider pagination, lazy loading, caching, or projection/read-model patterns before returning large payloads.
- Preserve observability for latency, throughput, queue depth, worker progress, and failure modes when touching hot paths.

## svcs And Registrar Pattern

- Before changing DI wiring, registrars, FastAPI lifespan setup, or `svcs` route dependencies, read `docs/patterns/svcs_notes.md`.
- Use FastAPI dependencies for request-local extraction, such as path/query/body values, request context, or route-local service assembly.
- Use `svcs.Registry` and registrar classes for reusable application/infrastructure dependencies.
- Keep registrar code mechanical: register factories/values, do not encode business policy.
- Keep lifecycle-owned resources in the lifespan/infrastructure setup path so startup and shutdown are explicit.
- Avoid hidden global singletons when a dependency belongs in `svcs`.

## Testing

- For test design, fixture placement, fakes, async tests, and DI overrides, use the `testing` skill.
- Test routes for validation, status codes, auth behavior, and DTO mapping.
- Test services with fake stores/queues/event logs where possible.
- For async code, cover cancellation, timeout, retry, and duplicate-processing behavior when relevant.
- For worker/agent-execution/event flows, assert both event sequence and derived/folded state when useful.

## Avoid

- Business logic embedded in route handlers.
- Returning persistence objects directly from routes.
- Raw dictionaries for stable interfaces.
- Blocking I/O inside `async def`.
- New framework-level dependency systems that bypass the existing FastAPI plus `svcs` composition model.
- Broad exception handlers that hide actionable failures.
