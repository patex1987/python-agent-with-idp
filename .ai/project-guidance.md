# Project AI Guidance

This repository is a Python 3.12 FastAPI service scaffold for an LLM agent backend. It currently combines a FastAPI API, OIDC/JWT authentication infrastructure, `svcs` dependency injection, Piccolo/PostgreSQL persistence, structured logging, and in-memory job/run orchestration patterns.

The project is being restarted after a pause. Prefer reading the current code and docs before making assumptions. Some older throttle/game/navigation code still exists as example or legacy domain code; do not treat it as the long-term product direction unless the current task explicitly says so.

## Repository Layout

- `llm_agent/`: Python package workspace and service runtime.
- `llm_agent/llm_agent/`: main FastAPI application package.
- `llm_agent/llm_agent/api/`: HTTP API, DTOs, mappers, routes, and middleware.
- `llm_agent/llm_agent/application/`: application-facing ports and request/auth context abstractions.
- `llm_agent/llm_agent/domain/`: domain objects and domain rules.
- `llm_agent/llm_agent/services/`: use-case orchestration services.
- `llm_agent/llm_agent/infrastructure/`: concrete adapters for auth, execution context, database, and service discovery.
- `llm_agent/llm_agent/di/`: `svcs` registry and FastAPI composition.
- `llm_agent/agent_run_worker/`, `llm_agent/contracts/`, `llm_agent/local_runtime/`: worker, contracts, event log, queue, and run-store experiments.
- `llm_agent/tests/`: tests and fake implementations.
- `docs/`: project documentation, architecture notes, plans, patterns, and knowledge.
- `.ai/`: canonical AI guidance. Generated tool files are produced from this folder by `.ai/sync.sh`.

## Development Commands

- Install or sync dependencies from `llm_agent/`: inspect the local `pyproject.toml` first and use the existing Python environment tooling.
- Run tests from `llm_agent/`: `uv run pytest` or `pytest`, depending on the active environment.
- Run focused tests from `llm_agent/`: `uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py -k "<case>"`.
- Run Ruff checks from `llm_agent/`: `uv run ruff check .` when Ruff is available in the environment.
- Run the app from `llm_agent/`: `uv run --env-file ../configuration/local_or_ide/local_development.env python manage.py`.
- Docker and dependency services are described in `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `llm_agent/README.md`.

When the exact command is uncertain, inspect `llm_agent/pyproject.toml`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, and existing scripts before inventing a new workflow.

## Code And Architecture Conventions

- Prefer small, incremental changes that fit the existing package structure.
- Keep FastAPI-specific concerns in the API layer: routes, DTOs, mappers, middleware, and dependency extraction.
- Keep application services focused on use cases and orchestration.
- Keep domain objects and domain rules free of FastAPI, database, and framework concerns.
- Keep infrastructure adapters behind protocols or narrow interfaces where the code already follows that pattern.
- Use `svcs` registration as the composition boundary. Avoid hidden global dependencies.
- Preserve async boundaries carefully. Do not block the event loop with synchronous I/O in request paths.
- Treat worker/run/event-log code as concurrency-sensitive. Be explicit about state transitions, idempotency, cancellation, and event ordering.
- Prefer typed Python with clear dataclasses/Pydantic models over unstructured dictionaries at boundaries.
- Keep comments sparse and useful: explain decisions, invariants, or non-obvious side effects.

## Testing Guidance

- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- Prefer narrow unit tests for pure domain/application logic.
- Use fake implementations for ports and stores where they make behavior easier to isolate.
- Add integration-style tests around FastAPI routes, middleware behavior, DI wiring, worker orchestration, and event-log invariants when those boundaries change.
- For cancellation, claiming, leases, and event logs, assert both emitted events and the folded/derived state where possible.
- Run the narrowest useful tests while iterating, then run the relevant full check before handing work back.

## Security And Operations

- Do not commit secrets, tokens, credentials, local `.env` values, or copied JWTs.
- Treat OIDC discovery, JWKS validation, token extraction, authorization, and user identity propagation as security-sensitive.
- Validate external input at API boundaries with Pydantic/FastAPI DTOs.
- Avoid logging raw tokens, credentials, PII, or full request payloads unless explicitly safe.
- Keep health endpoints simple and platform-friendly.
- Be explicit about database migration behavior, connection pooling, and startup side effects.

## Documentation

- Use `docs/plans/` for implementation plans.
- Use `docs/architecture/` for durable architecture decisions and topology notes.
- Use `docs/patterns/` for reusable implementation patterns.
- Use `docs/knowledge/` for durable project context and research notes.
